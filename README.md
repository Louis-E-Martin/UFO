## Overveiw
In this project our goal was to make a website that could take in data from our data sheet then put it into a table on our webpage. Then we added the functionality of being able to search through our table with multiple metrics at once so that the table was easily sortable and you could find exactly the data you wanted

## Results
You could use this webpage to filter down what you want through 5 diffrent criteria in our table. You can search by date, country, state, shape and city. All you have to do is type in a valid value and when you click out of the box to type in what you want the table will update with what you have entered. If you enter more values in diffrent boxes it will add those to your sort. Lastly if you want to undo the sort all you have to do is remove your value from the field and the table will update.

## Summary
One draw back of this new design is you have to use exact values to select anything you cant pick values inbetween each other like any date between two dates. Some improvments I can thinik of is first giving a funtionality to search inbetween two dates instead of having to enter every date by hand and only seeing those dates. Another thing I would add is for fields with less values maybe a drop down menu of the list of values you can select from so that you have an idea of what are some values you could potentially search by.
